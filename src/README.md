## 1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modern JavaScript/TypeScript workflow using Webpack for bundling, TypeScript for static typing, Sass (SCSS) for styling, ESLint and Prettier for code quality, and Jest for testing. It features code splitting, using dynamic imports for the moment librart, and automated code quality checks with Husky pre-commit hooks.

## 2. Setup and Run Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Install dependencies:**

   npm install

3. **Start the development server:**

   npm run dev

   This will start the Webpack dev server and build CSS from Sass.

4. **Build for production:**

   npm run build

   This creates an optimized bundle in the `dist` directory.

## 3. Build Process & Code Quality

### **Webpack**

- Bundles TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- Supports code splitting via dynamic `import()`.
- Outputs source maps for easier debugging.
- Handles both development and production builds with separate configs.

### **TypeScript**

- Provides static typing.
- Configured to support JSON imports and ES module interop.

### **Sass (SCSS)**

- Styles are written in `src/styles/main.scss`.
- Compiled to CSS using the `build-css` npm script.

### **Linting Rules**

- Uses ESLint with recommended and TypeScript rules.
- Custom rules: single quotes, semicolons required, warn on unused variables.
- Jest globals are recognized in test files.

### **Formatting Strategy**

- Prettier enforces consistent code formatting (single quotes, semicolons, LF line endings).
- Formatting is integrated with ESLint and run automatically before commits.

## 4. Available NPM Scripts

`start` Start Webpack dev server (development mode)  
 `build` Build the project for production  
 `build-css` Compile Sass (SCSS) to CSS  
 `dev` Run both dev server and build CSS  
 `lint` Run ESLint on TypeScript files  
 `format` Format code using Prettier  
 `check` Run lint and format together  
 `test` Run Jest tests  
 `prepare` Set up Husky git hooks  
 `precommit` Run lint and format before each commit (via Husky)

---

## 5. Testing Information

- **Test Framework:** Jest (with `ts-jest` for TypeScript support)
- **Test Files:** Place tests in files ending with `.test.ts` in the `src` directory.
- **Run Tests:**

  npm test

- **Test Environment:** Uses `jest-environment-jsdom` for DOM-related tests.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Code Splitting:** Dynamic imports for `moment.js` ensure only necessary code is loaded.
- **Pre-commit Hook:** Husky runs linting and formatting checks before every commit to maintain code quality.
- **Source Maps:** Enabled for easier debugging in both development and production.
